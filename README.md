This repository contains the completed first project for Michael Ohakwe of the Udacity program AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. In this project I used a dog classifier function that could use 3 differend CNN Architecture models to classify images as dogs or not dogs and give correctly give their breed. The program outputs statistics on the speed and accuracy of each model.
